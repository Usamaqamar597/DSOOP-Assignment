# DSOOP-Assignment
 Assignment dealing with complex number,differnt operations on it and lastly linklist of complex numbers

                                                  STEPS TO FOLLOW

1- Open the source file uploaded with the name "ubq.cpp" on any IDE (Visual Studio 2010 is Prefferable).

2- Then Bulid solution and debug it.

3- Enter complex number's real and imaginary part one by one,thus three complex numbers would be entered.

4- That's,it differnt operations on complex numbers and the linklist so created step by step would be visible on the black screen.

5- At last press any key to successfully close the debugger.


                                                        DISCRIPTION

The program automatically will prompt the user to enter complex number's imageanry and real part one by one.Three complex numbers numbers would be added by the users.

Now as per the instructions the first two numbers are added and stored in the linklist. Then linklist is also visible on the screen . Similarly by subtracting first and third complex number the output is stored in the list and also made visible on the linklist at last.Now program itself will add the first and third complex number and store it at lastof the linklist.Lastly the complex number at the 4th position is deleted by using the function so made in the program.

After each step/Operation the results are displayed.The results of multiplication and divsion are verified as per standard complex number's multiplication and division. Excetion Handling is also implemented in the program as we have may appear with condition when the denomenator will become exactly equal to zero. Overall the code is well organized and clear.
